# bulltrue
The idea behind this redo was to go with bigger, friendlier buttons and more strightforward game play. There was a high percentage of people who found the buttons in V1.0 confusing, which was understandable. While I thought that was actually very in tune with the idea behind the game, it's not fun to play if you feel like the game design is undermining your score.

I experimented a ton with button states and animations. Through most of development I had the fact box itself move over to the BULL side or True side. But that threw off the whole design and was abandoned, but gave me an idea for another game where the player is given 10 facts and told ahead of time that half are true and half are false. The player sorts and resorts them until it looks right and then submits the whole thing. Like a matching quiz. Might be worthwhile, but I don't want to spend too much time on design and CSS if it's not where I need to be. Game design is fun though.

Codewise, I built this on an array of objects. I was hoping to expand my understanding of objects, but it ended up not being very different from v1.0 The only real difference is teh syntax for accessing the values. I built in counters for stats and made the game a little bit more responsive to how the player is doing. 

If nothing else, I succeeded in making the buttons bigger, as the are not half of the screen!
