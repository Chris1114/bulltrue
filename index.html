            Since the dawn of man, human beings have been natural liars. It started with hunting...The better you were at deception, the better you and your family ate, the better chance you had of passing your liar genes forward. </br></br>
                Man's relatively recent mastery over his environment has made this ability to deceive unnecessary. We are hunters no more. Evolution, however, doesn't stop on a dime. It is estimated that people lie up to 3 times in a 10-minute conversation. Development of lying in four-year-olds is considered normal. We elect leaders knowing full well that they lie...We just try to pick the one that lies the least. Lying is alive and well, hanging in there better than our vanishing pinky toes.</br></br>
    In this world full of liars, the ability to sniff out BS has become the survival skill. BullTrue is designed to put your lie detection skills to the test.
