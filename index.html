            Humans are natural liars. It started with hunting. There is no greater deception than fooling something so you can kill it. These days, it is estimated that people lie up to 3 times in a 10-minute conversation.</br></br>
            We are also pre-programmed to believe what we are told. These two forces grind against each other, making the ability to detect lies the new survival skill. BullTrue is designed to test that ability.<br><br> 
        <h3>
